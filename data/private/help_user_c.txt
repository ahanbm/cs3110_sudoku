Game Rules and Feedback:
  If a player successfully connects four discs in a row, column, or diagonal, they win the game.
  If the grid is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
  The game will indicate who wins if it senses a victory.
  If a column is full, attempting to drop a disc in that column will prompt you to choose another column.

Enjoy the game and good luck!
